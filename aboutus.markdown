## History
(provided courtesy of Gary Barton)

White water paddling has a long history at McMaster. Before the advent of play paddling in little plastic boats white water kayaking in Ontario meant racing. You may not always race, but chances are you got your start that way because you knew someone who did it. Also, everyone knew everyone else in the Sport because it was so small. 
 
There was a string of paddlers at Mac through the 70s and 80s who were Provincial and National team members (Don Irvine, Maureen Bretz, Bill Blight, Peter Van Den Andel, Dieter Poenn, Dave Riley, Mike Elrick, Gary Barton to name a few). There used to be a series of pool slalom events in the winter at University pools (Mac, Queens and Ottawa).  We traditionally had pool time at Mac on Sundays, when local Hamilton White Water Club members (Harry Hewick was a notable local member along with his nephews) would also come to the Mac pool as well. At some point we wanted more pool time to train. The pool admin pushed back saying we couldn't. So we formed an offical student club at Mac, then they had to give us pool time. This also gave us a budget from the student union. We did trips and a lot of instruction of new members. Gary Barton also ran a kayaking program for Phys-Ed students.
 
A few years later, the kayak club became the Outers Club. The focus changed to include a variety of outdoor activities. Racers started to gravitate towards schools in the Ottawa or Vancouver areas.

## Rebirth
In 2006  Robbie Gibb, Jeff Masuda, Steve Bickerton, Laura Duncan and Stacey Gray got together to form what is known as McMaster White Water today. Details are murky, but through dedication and countless hours contributed by volunteers, McMaster White Water now:

- Owns a fleet of white water boats
- Runs multiple "guided" trips every summer
- Runs pool sessions and beginner courses
- Facilitates peer trips among its members
