Welcome to McMaster Whitewater!  

We are a student run paddling club out of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.  We seek to teach new paddlers basic skills needed, and encourage advanced boaters as they develop their skills in the sport.  Through various pool and river courses, we aim to effectively teach students and members of the community the skills that are needed to safely enjoy the sport of whitewater kayaking.  We hope that you join us in the pool or on the river.  Lets paddle!

Welcome back to all the McMaster students!. We are happy to have the nice weather here and are looking forward to getting out on the water! 

Pool sessions are starting up again! The first session will run Friday September 20th, 2013, from 8.30pm to 9.30pm, at the Ivor Wynne Centre Pool (IWC). The will continue at the same time and place for the remainder of the year. The cost of the pool sessions is $3 per pool session or $25 for the semester

If you are intersted in taking a course with us this fall, check out the [courses section](http://www2.mcmasterwhitewater.ca/course.html) section of our website.  There is lots of fun to be had on the river this summer so don't miss out.
