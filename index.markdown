Pool sessions are over for the season. They will  restart in the fall.

If you are just starting or contemplating whether this addictive past time is for you, we suggest waiting for warmer weather. [Palmerfest](http://paddlerco-op.com/content/make-reservation-0), is a great opportunity to get paddling instruction on the river.  The club runs [beginner trips](http://www2.mcmasterwhitewater.ca/trips.html) in the summer months. More information coming soon about these. Also check out the [courses](courses.html) we offer in the fall and winter. 

If you are an intermediate or experienced paddler, navigate to the [forum section](http://mcmasterwhitewater.ca/forum) to find out what the current members are up to. Remember to be safe out there.
