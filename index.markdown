Welcome to McMaster Whitewater!  

We are a student run paddling club out of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.  We seek to teach new paddlers basic skills needed, and encourage advanced boaters as they develop their skills in the sport.  Through various pool and river courses, we aim to effectively teach students and members of the community the skills that are needed to safely enjoy the sport of whitewater kayaking.  We hope that you join us in the pool or on the river.  Lets paddle!

We are happy to have the nice weather here and are looking forward to getting out on the water again! 

Pool sessions are done for the school term, but we will have them up and running come September.

If you are intersted in taking a course with us this summer, check out the [courses section](http://www2.mcmasterwhitewater.ca/course.html) section of our website.  There is lots of fun to be had on the river this summer so don't miss out.

If you are an intermediate or experienced paddler, navigate to the [forum section](http://mcmasterwhitewater.ca/forum) to find out what the current members are up to. Also, be sure to check us out on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mcmaster.whitewater)



Remember to be safe out there!
