Spring is finally here. A few remaining pool sessions will help you to hone your skills before the most trying and exciting part of the season - spring run off. Remember to be safe out there.

If you are just starting or contemplating whether this addictive past time is for you, we suggest waiting for warmer weather. Palmerfest is a good festival to check out. Also check the [courses](courses.html) we offer in the fall and winter.

If you are an intermeadiate or experienced paddler navigate to the [forum section](http://mcmasterwhitewater.ca/forum) to find out what the current members are up to.
